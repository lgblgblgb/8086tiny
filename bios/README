The original source used a custom BIOS loaded in run-time from a file.
Though I understand it's a great way to have a compact C source size,
I think it's better to include the BIOS in the C source itself, because
anyway, 8086tiny simply won't work without its own BIOS.

In case of any modification, say 'make' in this directory! The reason
it's not included in the "main" Makefile: some may not have 'nasm'
installed and want to use the shipped bios anyway when compiling
8086tiny.
